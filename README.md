   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following variables:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1d
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   ```

4. Start the backend server:
